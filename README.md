# CallServices
Basic api implementation on back-end level on Call services.
The Api works by creation a call, sms, or e-mail to send with its status on sending.
After they are created the program enters the service in a randimizer which chooses a random status from a list and returns the status to the end user.
The program uses an Authorisation token in order to create a session for the user and allow only users with certain authorisations to be able to ecexute certain comands.
